#summary More on directory structure

= Introduction =

Hi everyone,

I'd like to update Raza's instructions on directory structure, using some recent work of mine as an example. 

My task was to develop classes for a global environment, which could
be modified by  various shell actions. 


All the code is in a new directory called "global" (do svn update to
see this in the src directory).

The file combinatory_language.bon has been modified by adding a single
line

%open "globals/globals.bon";;

before the shell classes are declared. By contrast, your line will go after   %open "Shell.bon";;


The file "globals/globals.bon" begins with 

%cd "globals";;

and ends with 

%cd ".."

In between are the open commands for the various files containing
classes.

This approach will make it easy to load the whole system. When your
individual work is to be assessed, I will load fragments of the whole.


Most of you will need to move files within svn. This is easy. For
example, suppose that greatthan.bon is to go into a subdirectory
called integers. Run the following commands

mkdir integers
svn add integers
svn mv greatthan.bon integers
svn commit -m "created integers directory"

Note that moving files in any other way will confuse svn and then us.
