= Basic SVN Commands.=

Some students were having trouble with SVN so here are a few basic commands.


Adding a new file -- svn add filename.bon

Deleting a file -- svn delete filename.bon

Updating svn on YOUR machine --svn update

Committing -- 
After you do any of the above, to make the changes permanent you need to commit.  svn commit -m "Added filename.c"

I'm not a pro at this so if anyone wants to add/change something go ahead.
